It's not advisable to be airy fairy but this little detail is both important and not important all that same time.

Most CSS developers will use dashes to separate words in class names or ids etc. But I use lower camel case.

	// this
	.someClassName {
		/* ... */
	}

	// not this
	.some-class-name {
		/* ... */
	}

With that said, whether we use dashes or not does not affect the approach and architecture of Maintainable CSS. Use whichever you prefer.

For the sake of everyone else, I will use dashes for all examples.

Let's move along shall we?
