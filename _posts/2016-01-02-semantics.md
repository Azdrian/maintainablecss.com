> &ldquo;There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.&rdquo;
<br>&mdash; Phil Karlton

Naming stuff is important. First thing to note is that how we name stuff in HTML is what matters the most. Foundations are the most important, because anything else is papering over the cracks and will only last so long.

Whilst it's obvious you should use a table for tabular data, and a link for a link, and a paragraph for a paragraph (though there are plenty of examples of people not doing this) this stuff is obvious so Maintainable CSS doesn't address this.

I am talking about the additional class names (and ids) we sprinkle all over our HTML to give it additional meaning and hooks for CSS and Javascript to come along and enhance it as appropriate.

Ultimately, what you *must* not break is this statement: ** Name something based on what it *is*, not what it *does*, and not how it looks.**

## Examples

Are coming soon.
