A module is a section of the page that represents a piece of functionality in it's own right. It is visually identifable as a 'thing' that does 'something'.

For example a search feature residing within the header might be a module.

The *header* itself might be a module made up of other modules such as *logo*, *navigation* and the aformentioned *search* module.

Some might try to differentiate between a module and a modules that reside within a module but I don't think it's worth differentiating&mdash;it's a mental burden which I don't think helps the [goal of Maintainable CSS](/chapters/1/).

You will see what I mean when we carry out some examples together and ultimately you can decide if a module within a module in it's own right or a component of that module. You will see it doesn't matter too much.

## Identifying a module from the visual design

Examples coming soon.
