Whether you choose to utilise lower (or upper) camel case or use (double) dashes or underscores to delimit your CSS it really doesn't matter.

What matters is *consistency*.

With that said *Maintainable CSS* has the following conventions:

	.<moduleName>[-<componentName>][-<state>] {}

You will notice that the first segment is mandatory and each segment is split with a dash, and each segment is named using lowerCamelCase.

Don't worry, this will be explained in upcoming chapters.
