*Maintainable CSS* is an approach to writing CSS that helps you, your current team and your future team to maintain CSS.

## What is the goal of *Maintainable CSS*?

If I had to sum up the overarching goal of *Maintainable CSS* in one paragraph it would be as follows:

**To ensure that as a developer, I can edit an existing feature (or add a new one) to the codebase without worrying that overzealous, pre-existing styles will cause me a problem and require me to override or avert all together by adding unnecessary styles.**

*Maintainable CSS* is not something you can download. It's a set of principles, guides and conventions that not only allow you to write CSS with piece of mind, but that also means your CSS is maintainable and scalable.

## What does maintainable even mean?

It means I want to edit a module without having to worry that I have just fucked other modules on the site that I am not even aware of. It also means that if I write some new code, then my first job *isn't* to override a bunch of styles that I have just inherited.

## What does scalable even mean?

This means when the CSS gets bigger, is it harder to edit existing code and add new code. If you have ever inherited a large CSS codebase I am sure you can sympathise with these problems.

## What does modular even mean?

Coming soon.

## Who is this for?

These conventions are useful for tiny projects with 1 person on the team and equally they are useful for huge projects with 100 people on the team. And whether your design is set in stone for th next 5 years or will evolve frequently, *Maintainable CSS* can help.
