> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
&mdash; Phil Karlton

So this is very important and not something to gloss over.

There is lot's to be interpreted when it comes to semantics but let me be super clear about it here: it's how we name stuff in HTML that matters.

Foundations matter the most. HTML is our foundation. I am not talking about using a `p` for a paragraph &mdash; anyone not doing the obvious basics is just silly.

I am talking about how we sprinkle class names and ids in the HTML to provide additional meanings and it comes down to this one statement:

**Name something based on what it is, *not* what it does, and *not* how it looks**.

I see this broken all the time everywhere on the web and I see and read millions of different justifications, but when you break the foundations everything else goes to shit.
