A developer should be able to edit a module without affecting another. They should be able to develop a new module without inheriting overzealous, pre-existing styles that will ultimately result in lots of overrides.

There is no framwork to download and this is preprocessor agnostic. This is a set of guiding principles and conventions that allow you to write CSS in a way that gives you confidence, that the CSS you write will be maintainable and scalable.

### What does maintainable even mean?

It means I want to edit a module without having to worry that I have just fucked other modules on the site that I am not even aware of.

### What does scalable even mean?

This means when the CSS gets bigger, is it harder to edit existing code and add new code. If you have ever inherited a large CSS codebase I am sure you can sympathise with these problems.
