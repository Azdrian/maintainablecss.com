A module is a section of the page that represents a piece of functionality in it's own right. It is visually identifable as a 'thing' that does 'something'.

For example a search box in the header might be a module.

The header itself might be a module made up of other modules.

Some people might try and name a module that contains modules differently. For example they might say the header is a module and the bits inside it like a logo, a search form and menu might be components of the header module.

Maintainable CSS doesn't get that clever. It's a mental burden which I have found not to be necessary.

Now, if say the logo only ever appeared in the header, then it is arguable that the logo is just a *component* of the header *module*.

But let's not get into that right now &mdash; I don't think it's too important to get into that right now *and* the header with lots of bits inside is a little bit unique in its nature.

Ultimately, you decide what is a module and once this is done you can apply the principles and conventions to this.
