## Layouts and modules

Use same approach. Discuss 1 column mobile and 2 column.



Duplication first then reuse if you have to - colors, fonts blah.

- Working out what is a module
- Conventions
- Writing a module
- Don't be scared of IDs
- Layouts and modules
- Clearfix, red, pull-left bullshit
- Reuse if you have to
- IE hacks
- File organisation
- icons with empty spans?
- CSS 'variables' or just abstracting the common parts for reuse
- Overrides/opting in and opting out
- Conditional IE fixes, IE6, IE7, IE8
- File splits
- Readme?
- Wording -section/details/primary/wrapper/container/item/items
- selector intent
- A component should be styled in its own right. Just above portability
- Explicit naming
1- Up to naming UI components
