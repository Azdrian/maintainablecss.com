## Don't be scared of IDs

Sometimes we have to use them. Such as labels.

## Layouts and modules

Use same approach. Discuss 1 column mobile and 2 column.

## Clearfix, red, pull left

Coming soon.

## Reuse if you have to

Duplication first then reuse if you have to - colors, fonts blah.

## Other random notes


1. CSS 'variables' or just abstracting the common parts for reuse

2. Overrides/opting in and opting out

3. Conditional IE fixes, IE6, IE7, IE8

4. File splits

5. Readme?

6. Wording -section/details/primary/wrapper/container/item/items

7. selector intent

8. A component should be styled in its own right. Just above portability

9. Explicit naming

10. Up to naming UI components
