**As a developer you should be able to edit a module or add a new module to the codebase without concerning yourself with overzealous, pre-existing styles that will ultimately result on overrides for you and the next developer.**

Maintainable CSS is not something you can download. It's a set of principles, guides and conventions that not only allow you to write CSS with piece of mind, but that also means your CSS is maintainable and scalable.

These conventions are useful for tiny projects with 1 person on the team and equally they are useful for huge projects with 100 people on the team.

## What does maintainable even mean?

It means I want to edit a module without having to worry that I have just fucked other modules on the site that I am not even aware of. It also means that if I write some new code, then my first or second job *isn't* to override a bunch of styles that I have just inherited.

## What does scalable even mean?

This means when the CSS gets bigger, is it harder to edit existing code and add new code. If you have ever inherited a large CSS codebase I am sure you can sympathise with these problems.
