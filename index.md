## Preface

A developer should be able to edit a module without affecting another. They should be able to develop a new module without inheriting overzealous, pre-existing styles that will ultimately result in lots of overrides.

There is no framwork to download and this is preprocessor agnostic. This is a set of guiding principles and conventions that allow you to write CSS in a way that gives you confidence, that the CSS you write will be maintainable and scalable.

### What does maintainable even mean?

It means I want to edit a module without having to worry that I have just fucked other modules on the site that I am not even aware of.

### What does scalable even mean?

This means when the CSS gets bigger, is it harder to edit existing code and add new code. If you have ever inherited a large CSS codebase I am sure you can sympathise with these problems.

## A note about semantics

It is said that the hardest parts of programming are naming and caching. So I don't wish to gloss over this point...

And semantics starts with the HTML. Let's begin there.

## How we begin

Resets, base styles

## Working out what is a module

How to do this.

## Conventions

How I love lowerCamelCase but everyone does dashes. I will go with dashes to help everyone else but principles don't rely on dashes.

## Writing a module

Coming soon.

## Don't be scared of IDs

Sometimes we have to use them. Such as labels.

## Layouts and modules

Use same approach. Discuss 1 column mobile and 2 column.

## Clearfix, red, pull left

Coming soon.

## Reuse if you have to

Duplication first then reuse if you have to - colors, fonts blah.
