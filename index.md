# MaintainableCSS

An approach to architecting modular and easy to maintain CSS for teams and codebases big and small.

## Benefits of Maintainable CSS

1. **Modular and encapsulated** styles that don't bleed or cascade without *your* permission.
2. **Any design, any website** &mdash; completely flexible to *your* requirements.
3. **Requires no tooling** &mdash; feel free to use tooling, but there is no requirement
4. **There is very little to learn** &mdash; read the guides and see.
5. **Small or big** &mdash; works for any size project.
6. **Retrospective addition** &mdash; use it in your current project and start to feel the benefits bit by bit.
7. **No problem of specificity** &mdash; learn to avoid problems of specificity and require no overrides. Like every piece of CSS you write is a blank canvas.
8. **Managing state is easy** &mdash; change look and feel based on state with ease.
9. **No worry of regression** &mdash; when you change existing styles.
10. **Any team size** &mdash; helpful in a team of one, vital in a team of more.
11. **Semantic HTML and CSS** &mdash; easy to understand code, even if your new to the codebase.
12. **High performance** &mdash; flat and performant selectors.
